Server patch management strategy	Server software patches always come from the official, trusted source of the distribution. Application patches are always applied periodically plus as needed but with high priority (e.g., Heartbleed - we patched all servers in less than one day). Access to servers is limited to core senior engineers.
Describe Companyâ€™s Vulnerability & Penetration Testing, including internal and independent qualified 3rd parties that conduct testing. Please provide copies of the executive summaries.	We use Acunetix to scan for vulnerabilities and fix them. We conduct regular internal pen tests. We enforce segregation of roles and secure SDLC so as to prevent backdoors and malicious insiders. We use a variety of tools to scan for vulnerabilities, OWASP, Zap, Chimera, Acunetix. Well-known vulnerabilities are explicitly tested upon software QA and prior to accepting the new software built for integration in the servicesâ€™ code base. As part of our secure SDLC we define security acceptance criteria plus we maintain and constantly update a list of automated security checks that should be performed to test new functionality so as to mitigate risks against well-known threats (e.g. SQL injection, XSS, CSRF). We follow best practices in security. All attempts to connect to servers and REST calls are logged, as well as unathorized access attempts. Server software patches always come from the official, trusted source of the distribution. Hardened servers and application whitelisting. Hardening policy depends on the server type and OS. Everything that applies from https://docs.openstack.org/ansible-hardening/latest/ is done in our configurations. We also conduct regular internal pen tests. 
Intrusion Prevention - Detection?	No IDS/IPS.
Briefly describe Companyâ€™s documented process for installation and maintenance of software for protection against malicious code on all computing systems used directly or indirectly	We apply very restricted policy on the applications that can be installed on machines of personnel that have access to servers. Regarding the VMs themselves, we use best practices and Ansible hardening playbooks. The VM hardening policy depends on the server type and OS. Everything that applies from https://docs.openstack.org/ansible-hardening/latest/ is done in our configurations. As part of our secure SDLC we define security acceptance criteria plus we maintain and constantly update a list of automated security checks that should be performed to test new functionality so as to mitigate risks against well-known threats (e.g. SQL injection, XSS, CSRF). We follow best practices in security. We also deal with vulnerabilities coming from the software stack and server infrastructure required for our services and respond to them in a timely fashion based on the respective level of severity/risk (e.g., Heartbleed - we patched all servers in less than one day).
Does your organization have a security incident response team 24x7 to respond to security incidents?	We have Security Incident Response Team and apply the federated model advised by NIST maintaining multiple security teams for our infrastructure and services. However, we cannot provide 24x7 availability of our security teams and rely on automated tools for security-related incident detection
Do you have a dedicated person responsible for data protection? If so, who?	Yes, Privacy Officer role undertaken by the CIO and also separate person as Information Security Officer.
Does your organization currently have a staffed and funded Security Incident Response Program available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year?	No, we do not support 24 x 7 x 365 incident response.
Does your organization currently have a policy which defines conditions under which security incidents will be responded to and what expected remediation time frames are acceptable for specific types of incidents?	Yes. Our process for managing a security incident conforms to the approach prescribed in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-61. We apply the federated model in incident response, hence we maintain several dedicated teams that work together to prevent, monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents. The companyâ€™s Security Team and the service teams work jointly and take the same approach to security incidents, which include Preparation; Detection and Analysis; Containment, Eradication, and Remediation; and Post-Incident Activity. Prioritization and escalation according to NIST recommendations and evaluations of the company's Security Team and the Incident Response Teams involved when required.
Does your organization allow the use of shared network accounts?	No. Individual accounts per person, no sharing of accounts allowed.
Describe your organizationâ€™s password construction requirements.	Strong passwords and 2-factor authentication for servers using pem files - SSH required to access the server structure, in a non-default port, and exclusively via PKI (public key infrastructure), interactive logins are disabled. Regarding the service the admin may set up strong password policies, SSO and 2FA, as explained in https://www.efrontlearning.com/security and the respective knowledgebase articles (e.g. https://support. efrontlearning.com/hc/en-us/articles/114094004651-How-to-perform-Single-sign-on-SSO-with-eFront ; https://support.efrontlearning.com/hc/en-us /articles/114094004351-How-to-enable-2-factor-authentication.
Encryption (at rest/in transit)	At rest: All servers and backups are encrypted at rest with AES-256; on top of that passwords are salted and hashed. In transit: SSL/TLS 1.2 https://support.efrontlearning.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043441592-Why-your-eFront-portal-uses-the-TLS-1-2-protocol
Is there an operational change management/change control policy or program that has been approved by management, communicated to appropriate constituents and an owner to maintain and review the policy?	Yes, part of the company's QISMS that is certified with ISO 9001 and ISO 27001. Company staff may suggest policies to the Management for consideration. It is the sole responsibility of the Management to approve or deny the creation of the policy as constituent part of the companyâ€™s policy set. Similar for policy modification or erasure. Policies can be updated as part of the periodic reassessment carried out in the company or triggered as a response to an incident or external risk/threat identified. Policy updates requests are communicated to the company Management and Privacy and Security Teams (if needed) in a timely manner proportional to the urgency of the review sought. All policies are periodically reviewed by the Management, annually the latest. The company policies electronic document is accessible by all company personnel at all times. Policies are communicated inside the company through electronic communication (periodically emailed every month and after policy review- updating, as well as to new personnel upon hiring) and training.

Do you currently have the ability to destroy all customer data within 45 days of termination of contract?	We have this ability that can be activated by you upon request; the standard way to deal with domains after contract termination is the following: All data are kept for 12 months after an account cancellation. This is to ensure that a service re-connection will be as smooth as possible. Inactive domains for a period of 12 months are then deleted by the system. Regarding user records or course records, these can be (exported and) deleted from your domain admins user types at any time through the application. Last but not least, upon request our engineers can permanently delete (all) data stored inside TalentLMS related to your service. Feel free to contact us at privacy@talentlms.com. We will respond to your request within 30 days.
Do you currently provide a "single tenant" (i.e. hosts, databases, etc. not shared between customers) option for all infrastructure and application dependencies in your service?	No, we use AWS cloud hosting where there is multi-tenancy. However, we encrypt all communications and the TalentLMS DB Layer stores the user and application data in isolated spaces. MySQL with InnoDb tables is used to provide the Database layer services. Network zoning ensures that database servers remain restricted in the internal network. Only web servers can be contacted via the internet. 
Will the provision of your services (including any back up services) involve the transfer of any data outside the EEA? If yes, please provide details.	Our servers are located in the US.
